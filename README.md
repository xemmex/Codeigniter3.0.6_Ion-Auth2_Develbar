# Codeigniter 3.0.6 + Ion Auth 2(Authentication) + Develbar(Developer Toolbar)

# What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

# Ion Auth 2

The future of authentication

by Ben Edmunds

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential. It's lightweight, simple, and clean, but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features. So we refactored the code and added new features.

This version drops any backwards compatibility and makes things even more awesome then you could expect.
